 * x86-64 windows doesn't support inline asm so we have to use these
 * intrinsic functions defined in the compiler.  Not all of these are well
 * documented.  There is an array in the compiler dll (c1.dll) which has
 * an array of the names of all the intrinsics minus the leading
 * underscore.  Searching around in the ntddk.h file can also be helpful.
 *
 * The declarations for the intrinsic functions were taken from the DDK.
 * Our declarations must match the ddk's otherwise the 64-bit c++ compiler
 * will complain about second linkage of the intrinsic functions.
 * We define the intrinsic using the basic types corresponding to the
 * Windows typedefs. This avoids having to include windows header files
 * to get to the windows types.
